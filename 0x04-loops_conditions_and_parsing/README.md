## Loops

### For Loop

The `for` loop in Bash allows you to iterate over a range of values, elements in an array, or output from a command.

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Iteration $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

### Until Loop

The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop but continues until a specified condition becomes true.

```bash
counter=1
until [ $counter -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Iteration $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

## Conditions

### If Statement

The `if` statement allows you to conditionally execute code based on a specified condition.

```bash
age=18
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are eligible to vote."
else
    echo "You are not eligible to vote yet."
fi
```

### Case Statement

The `case` statement provides a way to match a value against multiple patterns.

```bash
fruit="apple"
case $fruit in
    "apple")
        echo "It's a delicious apple."
        ;;
    "orange")
        echo "It's a juicy orange."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit."
        ;;
esac
```

## Parsing

### Command-Line Arguments

Bash allows you to parse command-line arguments using `$1`, `$2`, etc., to access positional parameters.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Second Argument: $2"
```

### Parsing Input

You can read and parse user input in a script using the `read` command.

```bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read username
echo "Hello, $username!"
```

## Conclusion

This README provides a brief overview of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting. Experiment with the examples provided to gain hands-on experience and enhance your scripting skills. Bash scripting is a powerful tool, and mastering these concepts will enable you to automate tasks and efficiently manage system operations. Happy scripting!
