Shell variables can be used in a variety of ways, such as:

Passing values to commands
Storing the results of commands
Controlling the behavior of the shell
Shell Expansions
Shell expansions are a way of expanding the value of a shell variable or string. There are a variety of different shell expansions, but some of the most common ones include:

Parameter expansion: This expansion expands the value of a shell variable. For example, the <span class="math-inline">name\ expansion expands to the value of the `name` variable. * **Command substitution:** This expansion executes a command and expands the output of the command to a string. For example, the `(ls)expansion expands to the output of thels` command.
Arithmetic expansion: This expansion performs arithmetic operations on the value of a shell variable. For example, the ${1+2} expansion expands to the value of 1+2, which is 3.
Shell expansions can be used to make your shell scripts more powerful and versatile. For example, you could use a shell expansion to pass the current date and time to a command, or to calculate the size of a file.
